)))A file to record all notes as i learn and implement modules/ functions/ concepts and much more)))

1) // ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED generally occurs when your application or one of its modules attempts to use an algorithm or key size thatâ€™s no longer allowed by default with OpenSSL 3.0.
   // In other words, Node.js throws an ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED error to prevent you from using a feature that OpenSSL removed for security reasons.
   // Temporary Fix: 
   // export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider

2) Token based authentication setup and implementation -> firebase.util.js and authentication.component.jsx (../src/utils/firebase/firebase.util.js)
   email based authentication setup and implementation -> firebase.util.js and authentication.component.jsx

3) const var_name = () => {...} // this is an anonymous function assigned to a variable

4) libraries change or upgrade frequently in react, must update syntax and patterns when they do

5) firebase is a suite of tools and firestore is one of them
   authentication is different from firestore, firestore is schema-less db (pretty much a JSON obj, user defined var)

6) import {...} from URL ---> export const, import comp_name from URL ---> export default

7) error handling/ bug fixing technique
   -> open developer tools F12/ctrl+shift+i
   -> observe the error code in console EX: Error (auth/cancelled-popup-request).
   -> handle in catch block EX: catch(error){if(error.code==="auth/cancelled-popup-request"){...alert or handle...}console.log(error);}

0) learn about async method, spread operator in js, interpolation {`${}`} )))
