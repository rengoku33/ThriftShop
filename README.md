# A react web application for E-Commerce website

I worked on this project in order to learn and implement react hooks, listener functions and other important concepts such as authentication, authorization, DB connectivity, scalabality and much more. In other words, This project can be considered as a workspace to test my theory and expand my knowledge. I wanted to use express JS for handling requests but I have already worked with it so I implemented React-Router-Dom module in this project in order to learn other ways to handle HTTP requests.

Front-end: JS, SCSS, Styled Components --- Back-end: JS, Firebase(Firestore) <br />
Hosted using Netlify --- Deployed at https://flourishing-cannoli-b392cb.netlify.app/ <br />
Tools, Frameworks and Environments used: React JS, Node JS, NPM package manager, VS Code and much more  

### WARNING! 
You will find lots of comments in the source code on several components, this is because I was learning and implementing concepts as I code. I have dedicated a separate file to rocord my notes as well, It can be found under "/main/public/notes.txt".

### Note:
The web application is not mobile compatible, it partially works on mobile as few scss classes are designed to adapt to screen resolution but not all.
